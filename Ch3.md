## Interfaces 
Interfaces are a contract that can be used to abstract functionality to prevent vendor lock in and made code more testable. 

This chapter will show an example for how to use an interface to perform the same functionality across gateways.


The use case is as follows:
As a user
When I delete an todo
Then I want the item deleted and a log persisted to long term storage
