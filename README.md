# javapractice

A repo to practice some java.

It's broken down into chapters that are in separate branches. 

The branches have a cascade of pull requests, so ch1 pulls against main, ch2 pulls against ch1, etc. This is to allow comparison of concepts that build on each other by inspecting the files that are changed in a given pull request. 

I'm trying to keep the readmes for the various chapters updated in the main branch, but it's best to check out that branch to view the most up to date readme.
