# Javapractice

A repo to practice some java.
It's broken down into chapters that are in separate branches with their respective readmes that help explain the differnt pull requests to isolate different concentrations as follows. 
There are comments throughout code that help explain what each piece is doing.

## Getting Started
I'd glance at the readme to get a general sense of what the chapter is about then dive into the PR to see how it's implemented in code

### Readmes and PRs 
- [Ch1.md](https://github.com/sprintup/javapractice/blob/ch1-springboot-setup/Ch1.md) | [Ch1: readme updates](https://github.com/sprintup/javapractice/pull/2/files) just describes how the base project is set up.
- [Ch2.md](https://github.com/sprintup/javapractice/blob/ch2-clean-code-architecture-end/Ch2.md) | [Ch2: clean code architecture end](https://github.com/sprintup/javapractice/pull/6/files) adds a single 'AddTodoInteractor' to add a todo item to a database.
- [Ch3.md](https://github.com/sprintup/javapractice/blob/ch3-interfaces-end/Ch3.md) | [Ch 3: Interfaces implemented](https://github.com/sprintup/javapractice/pull/8/files) uses interfaces so a single interactor can interface with multiple gateways.
- [Ch4.md](https://github.com/sprintup/javapractice/blob/ch4-tests-end/Ch4.md) | [Ch4: tests end](https://github.com/sprintup/javapractice/pull/9/files) shows how to set up a single unit test.
